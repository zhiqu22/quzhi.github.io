About Me
======
I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Nara Institute of Science and Technology](https://www.naist.jp/) (NAIST), supervised by [Prof. Taro Watanabe](https://sites.google.com/site/tarowtnb).
I am also an intern at the [National Institute of Information and Communi-cations Technology](https://www.nict.go.jp/) (NICT), Japan, where I am mentored by [Associate Prof. Chenchen Ding](https://att-astrec.nict.go.jp/member/ding/).
My research focuses on machine translation, particularly in multilingual settings. I also maintain a broad interest in natural language processing (NLP) in general.

You can learn more about me through my [Publications](#publications), [Educations](#educations) and [Research Experiences](#research_experiences).
You also can find my [ACL Profile](https://aclanthology.org/people/z/zhi-qu/) and [OpenReview Profile](https://openreview.net/profile?id=%7EZhi_Qu2).
